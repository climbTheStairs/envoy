Envoy (the name is subject to change)
is a project with the purpose of implementing
most of the features of Microsoft Teams,
a (unfortunately) popular communication platform
for education and business.

It should be able to serve as an alternative to Teams,
but simpler, more lightweight,
and with a user interface that is friendlier and more intuitive.

This is my high school capstone project. 

## Features

- User accounts
- Team creation and management
- ...

## Non-features

Due to time constraints,
I am currently unable to implement *all* of Teams's features.

- Security
- Voice or video calls
- Mobile support
- ...
