Envoy (the name is subject to change)
is a project with the purpose of implementing
most of the features of Microsoft Teams,
a (unfortunately) popular communication platform
for education and business.

It should be able to serve as an alternative to Teams,
but simpler, more lightweight,
and with a user interface that is friendlier and more intuitive.

This started as my high school capstone project.
